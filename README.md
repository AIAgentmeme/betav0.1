# AI Hedge Fund

This is a proof concept for an AI-powered hedge fund.  The goal of this project is to explore the use of AI to make trading decisions.  This project is for **educational** purposes only and is not intended for real trading or investment.

This system employs several agents working together:

1. Valuation Agent - Calculates the intrinsic value of a stock and generates trading signals
2. Sentiment Agent - Analyzes market sentiment and generates trading signals
3. Fundamentals Agent - Analyzes fundamental data and generates trading signals
4. Technical Analyst - Analyzes technical indicators and generates trading signals
5. Risk Manager - Calculates risk metrics and sets position limits
6. Portfolio Manager - Makes final trading decisions and generates orders
